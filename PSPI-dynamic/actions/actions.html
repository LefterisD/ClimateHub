								<h6 class="card-title">Founded: 1971, Vancouver, Canada</h6>
									<p class="card-text">Greenpeace is a non-governmental environmental organization with offices in over 55 countries.Greenpeace was founded in 1971 by Irving Stowe and Dorothy Stowe, Canadian and US ex-pat environmental activists. Greenpeace states its goal is to "ensure the ability of the Earth to nurture life in all its diversity" and focuses its campaigning on worldwide issues such as climate change, deforestation,overfishing, commercial whaling, genetic engineering, and anti-nuclear issues.
									<span class="dots">...</span>
									<span class="more"> 
									Greenpeace mentions that :    

									The last thing the world needs is more oil. As with other fossil fuels, our reliance on oil is fueling climate change, polluting priceless landscapes, and costing billions of dollars. We’ve got great opportunities today to build a cleaner energy system in time to avoid the worst impacts of climate change — and oil has no part in it.

									Fracking is the fossil fuel industry’s latest false solution to our energy challenge. It’s more expensive, more polluting, and more dangerous than clean, renewable energy.So why are we pursuing fracking in the first place?

									Nuclear energy has no place in a safe, clean, sustainable future. Nuclear energy is both expensive and dangerous, and just because nuclear pollution is invisible doesn’t mean it’s clean. Renewable energy is better for the environment, the economy, and doesn’t come with the risk of a nuclear meltdown.

									How We’re Changing the Climate?
									Humans are at the center of the problem, but this also means the power is in our hands. The choices we make today will determine the climate of the future.Ninety-seven percent of scientists agree that the Earth's temperature is rising and human activity plays a central role.

							<h2 class="card-title">Environmental Defense Fund</h2>
								<h6 class="card-title">Founded: 1967, New York, United States</h6>
									<p class="card-text">Environmental Defense Fund or EDF (formerly known as Environmental Defense) is a United States-based nonprofit environmental advocacy group. The group is known for its work on issues including global warming, ecosystem restoration, oceans, and human health, and advocates using sound science, economics and law to find environmental solutions that work. It is nonpartisan, and its work often advocates market-based solutions to environmental problems.
									<span class="dots">...</span>
									<span class="more"> 
									In 2006 EDF launched the Fight Global Warming campaign in partnership with the Ad Council and with support from the Robertson Foundation.The campaign was a wake-up call to the dangers of global warming that gave Americans tools and tips to reduce their carbon footprint.

									They initiatives include:

									Hastening the clean energy economy.
									Lowering climate pollution from natural gas.
									Boosting efforts to help China reduce pollution.
									Fostering sustainable land use to limit deforestation.

				    		<h6 class="card-title">Founded: 2007</h6>
				    			<p class="card-text">350.org is an international environmental organization addressing the climate crisis. Its stated goal is to end the use of fossil fuels and transition to renewable energy by building a global, grassroots movement.
				        		The 350 in the name stands for 350 ppm (parts per million) of carbon dioxide,which has been identified as the safe upper limit to avoid a climate tipping point.As of 2019, the current level has reached 415 ppm.
				        		Through online campaigns, grassroots organizing, mass public actions, and collaboration with an extensive network of partner groups and organizations, 350.org has mobilized thousands of volunteer organizers in over 188 countries.
				        		<span class="dots2">...</span>
								<span class="more2"> The fossil fuel divestment campaign, also known as "Fossil Free", borrows activist tactics from other social movements, notably the successful movement against apartheid in South Africa. Since its inception in 2012, over 1110 institutions with more than US$11 trillion in assets under management have committed to divest from fossil fuels. 350.org explains that the reasoning behind this campaign is simple: "If it is wrong to wreck the climate, then it is wrong to profit from that wreckage." 350.org states their demand as the following "We want institutions to immediately freeze any new investment in fossil fuel companies, and divest from direct ownership and any commingled funds that include fossil fuel public equities and corporate bonds.”
								The campaign has grown from colleges and universities around the United States to now include other kinds of public and private institutions, such as the City of New York, major Japanese banks, development banks, religious institutions and more. Campaigns for divestment are active and growing around the world.

				    		<h6 class="card-title">Founded: 2005</h6>
				    			<p class="card-text">The Verified Carbon Standard, Verra or VCS is a standard for certifying carbon emissions reductions. VCS is administered by Verra, a not-for-profit organization.In 2005, The Climate Group, International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) and The World Economic Forum - convened a team of global carbon market experts to draft the first VCS requirements.  These experts soon formed the VCS Steering Committee. Many of the members of the original steering committee went on to be on the original Board of Directors, which now has evolved into a body of 12 members that offers input and guidance to the organization.On February 15, 2018, the organization that maintains the Verified Carbon Standard changed its name from Verified Carbon Standard to Verra.
				        		<span class="dots2">...</span>
								<span class="more2"> Verra catalyzes measurable climate action and sustainable development outcomes by driving large-scale investment to activities that reduce emissions, improve livelihoods, and protect nature.
								Carbon accounting refers generally to processes undertaken to "measure" amounts of carbon dioxide equivalents emitted by an entity. It is used by states, corporations and individuals to create the carbon credit commodity traded on carbon markets (or to establish the demand for carbon credits). Likening sustainability measurement, as an instance of ecological modernisation discourses and policy, carbon accounting is hoped to provide a factual ground for carbon-related decision-making. However, social scientific studies of accounting challenge this hope, pointing to the socially constructed character of carbon conversion factors which cannot implement abstract accounting schemes into reality.

								While natural sciences claim to know and measure carbon, for organisations it is usually easier to employ forms of carbon accounting to represent carbon. The trustworthiness of accounts of carbon emissions can easily be contested.Thus, how well carbon accounting represents carbon is difficult to exactly know.

						<h2 class="card-title">CAN:Climate Action Network</h2>
							<h6 class="card-title">Founded: March 1989</h6>
								<p class="card-text">Climate Action Network - International (CAN) is an global network of over 1,300 environmental non-governmental organisations in over 130 countries working to promote government and individual action to limit human-induced climate change to ecologically sustainable levels. It also supports and coordinates its members in its global network through capacity-building, campaigns, projects and mobilisations to urge governments and other stakeholders to act on the climate emergency. CAN members work to achieve this goal through the coordination of information exchange and non-governmental organizational strategy on international, regional and national climate issues.

								<p class="card-text"><span class="more3">
								 <span id="more3">Glaciers, polar land, and sea ice are rapidly melting, much faster than many scientists expected, as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s report on oceans and the cryosphere released Wednesday reiterated. During a five-day heat wave this summer, Greenland lost more than 60 billion tons of ice. Recent projections warn that Arctic summers could be nearly ice-free in 10 to 40 years. Arctic ice levels are a key determinant of how bad climate change might get. 

								These grim warnings have prompted more researchers to apply technological solutions that intervene in the earth’s climate systems to slow the impacts of global warming, also known as “geoengineering.” 

								“We’re getting much more attention because of how dire thing are,” says inventor and engineer Leslie Field, founder of Ice911, a nonprofit exploring Arctic ice restoration who featured prominently at the climate restoration conference and in the strategic report organizers released.

						<h2 class="card-title">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</h2>
							<h6 class="card-title">Founded:1988</h6>
								<p class="card-text">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is an intergovernmental body of the United Nations that is dedicated to providing the world with objective, scientific information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of the risk of human-induced climate change, its natural, political, and economic impacts and risks, and possible response options.The IPCC provides an internationally accepted authority on climate change, producing reports that have the agreement of leading climate scientists and consensus from participating governments. The 2007 Nobel Peace Prize was shared between the IPCC and Al Gore.
								</p>
								<p class="card-text"><span class="more3">
								 <span id="more3">The latest IPCC Special Report on the Oceans and the Cryosphere (SROCC) lays out the full extent to which the world’s marine life, oceans, glaciers, mountains, polar ecosystems are being disrupted by the climate crisis. These changes, happening at an unprecedented pace and scale, are impacting hundreds of millions of people who are being pushed to dangerous limits of adaptation and suffering the consequences of loss and damage.

								The report shows that rising sea levels, rapidly melting ice sheets and the drastic warming of the oceans come with a steep ecological and social price- one that will increase with delayed action and will demand difficult choices with complicated trade-offs to protect people and our natural world. 

								It is the third major IPCC Special Report in less than a year sounding the alarm bell for fast and far-reaching decarbonisation to halve global emissions in the next decade, to support adaptation and to protect and restore nature.
								Political will must match scientific reality. It is time for timely, ambitious and concerted international cooperation that responds to the millions of global climate strikers who are demanding a better future and refuse to take no for an answer.
